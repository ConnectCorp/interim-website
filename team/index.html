				<h2>The world needs real social</h2>
				<h3>Our relationships, our health and our culture is fraying due to social tech that puts digital distraction first and humans second. We're on a mission to change that. We are domain experts in brain science, relational psychology, and calm tech. We spent the last 10 months doing deep design research with our customers to create technology that supports the way that humans actually socialize in real life. Our tech works *with* the human operating system, rather than hijacks it. We think people will like that.</h3>

					<h2>San Francisco for the win!</h2>
					<h3>Our penthouse office is designed for maximum productivity and fun: hold a meeting on our roof deck, whiteboard in a cozy collaboration nook, or cook dinner with a colleague in our full kitchen. Kombucha on tap? Yes. Array of costume hats for effective communication with teammates? Of course. Cononut chips dusted in cacao? Yes, you have found your people. We offer daily lunch, a massive stash of superfood snacks and beverages, and dinner if you're working late. We are located 1 block off Market Street and Powell BART, in the heart of SOMA, which makes commuting a snap.</h3>
