			<p>By accessing, downloading, installing, running or using the Connect Software Corporation ("Connect," “us,” "our," or "we") website, service, and/or applications, including any mobile applications, made available by Connect (together, the "Service"), you ("you," or "your") agree to be bound by these terms of use ("Terms"). These Terms constitute a binding legal agreement between you and Connect and affect your legal rights and obligations. If you do not agree with these Terms, you may not access, download, install, run or use the Service. You may only use the Site and Services in compliance with these Terms and only if you are at least 18 years old and legally capable of forming a contract with Connect. We retain the right to refuse to allow anyone to access and use the Service for any reason at any time. Although we currently provide the Service without charge, with prior written notice to you, we may begin charging you to use the Service.</p>
			<p><b>These Terms require the use of arbitration on an individual basis to resolve disputes, rather than jury trials or class actions, and limit the remedies available to you in the event of a dispute. Please see Section 17 below for more information.</b></p>
			<h2>1. RIGHT TO USE THE SERVICE</h2>
			<p>a. Access. Subject to the terms and conditions set forth herein, we hereby grant you a personal, limited, non-exclusive, revocable, non-sublicensable, non-transferable right to access and use the Service solely for its intended purposes. If applicable, your use of any mobile application comprising part of the Service is subject to your further agreement with the terms and conditions contained within such application and with the usage rules of the applicable mobile application store, including, but not limited to, the Apple Inc. App Store Terms of Service. Connect reserves the right to add, delete, or modify any term or condition within these Terms at any time and in its sole discretion.</p>
			<p>b. Changes. If we make a change to any term or condition, we will notify you by posting a change notice on the Service. In the event of substantive changes to these Terms, you may be notified by email of the changes, if your email is available. If any modification is unacceptable to you, you should immediately stop using the Service. Your continued use of the Service following notice of a change in the Terms will constitute your binding acceptance of the changes. We reserve the right to stop offering the Service at any time either permanently or temporarily. If we stop offering the Service, you understand and acknowledge we will not be required to provide any reimbursement or compensation to you in connection with such a discontinuation.</p>
			<h2>2. ACCOUNT</h2>
			<p>In order to use the Service, you must establish an account (the "Account") with us and, to the extent permitted by the Service, with certain online third party properties such as Facebook, Twitter and LinkedIn (each, a "Social Network"). If you establish an Account with Connect, you agree that you do not own or have any property interest in the Account. If you establish an Account with a Social Network, or use a preexisting Account with a Social Network, you understand you are solely responsible for ensuring that your use of such Account complies with all applicable foreign, federal and state laws and regulations and does not violate any term, condition, rule, procedure, policy or other guideline published by the Social Network. You agree to maintain your Account password in strict confidence. In the event your Account password is lost or otherwise compromised, you agree you will be responsible solely for all actions, damages, liabilities and losses incurred as a result of such loss or compromise. You are responsible for any fees, including internet connection or mobile fees, that you incur while using the Service.</p>
			<h2>3. RESTRICTIONS ON USE</h2>

			<p>(i)	perform or facilitate any act which, directly or indirectly, causes to be transmitted to, uploaded or downloaded by, the Service or any end user any software viruses, worms, Trojan horses, time bombs, trap doors or any other computer code, files or programs or repetitive requests for information designed to interrupt, destroy or limit the functionality of any computer software or hardware or telecommunications equipment or to diminish the quality of, interfere with the performance of, or impair the functionality of the Service;</p>

			<p>(c)	Certain Content may contain links to other websites that are completely independent of the Service. Connect makes no representation or warranty as to the accuracy, completeness or authenticity of the information contained on such other websites.</p>
			<h2>6.   FEEDBACK</h2>

			<h2>9. PROPRIETARY RIGHTS</h2>
			<p>(a)	As between you and Connect, all software embedded in the Service (the "Software") is and shall remain the sole and exclusive property of Connect.

			<h2>10. COPYRIGHT INFRINGEMENT</h2>
			<p>The Digital Millennium Copyright Act of 1998 (the “DMCA”) provides recourse for copyright owners who believe that material appearing on the Internet infringes their rights under U.S. copyright law. In appropriate circumstances and at Connect’s discretion, Connect may terminate your Account if you become a repeat copyright infringer. If you believe in good faith that any content made available in connection with the Service infringes your copyright, you (or your agent) may send us a notice requesting that the content be removed, or access to it blocked. Notices and counter notices must meet the then-current statutory requirements imposed by the DMCA (see http://www.copyright.gov for details).</p>
			<p>Currently, an effective notice must contain the following: (i) a physical or electronic signature of a person authorized to act on behalf of the owner of an exclusive right that is allegedly infringed; (ii) identification of the copyrighted work claimed to have been infringed, or, if multiple copyrighted works are covered by a single notification, a representative list of such works at that Service; (iii) identification of the claimed infringing material or subject of infringing activity that is to be removed or access to which is to be disabled, and information reasonably sufficient to permit us to locate the material; (iv) your address, telephone number, and, if available, your email address; (v) a statement that you have a good faith belief that use of the copyrighted material in the manner complained of is not authorized by the copyright owner, its agent, or the law; and (vi) a statement that the information in the notification is accurate, and under penalty of perjury, that you are authorized to act on behalf of the owner of an exclusive right that is allegedly infringed. </p>
			<p>Notices and counter notices with respect to the Service should be sent to Connect Software Corporation, Attn: Legal, 2 Mint Plaza # 801, San Francisco, CA 94105, or to <a href="mailto:copyright@connect.com">copyright@connect.com</a>.</p>

			<p>THE SERVICE IS PROVIDED "AS IS" AND "AS AVAILABLE" AND WITHOUT REPRESENTATION OR WARRANTY OF ANY KIND.

IN NO EVENT WILL CONNECT'S TOTAL CUMULATIVE LIABILITY FOR CLAIMS OF ANY KIND, WHETHER BASED ON CONTRACT, TORT, NEGLIGENCE, INDEMNITY OR OTHERWISE, FOR ANY LOSS OR DAMAGE ARISING OUT OF OR RELATED TO THESE TERMS OR THE SERVICE EXCEED THE LESSER OF ONE HUNDRED DOLLARS ($100) AND AMOUNTS ACTUALLY PAID BY CUSTOMER TO US IN THE SIX MONTHS PRIOR TO THE CLAIM. THE EXISTENCE OF MORE THAN ONE CLAIM WILL NOT ENLARGE THIS LIMIT.</p>
			<p>IF YOU ARE A CALIFORNIA RESIDENT, YOU WAIVE CALIFORNIA CIVIL CODE §1542 WHICH STATES: A GENERAL RELEASE DOES NOT EXTEND TO CLAIMS WHICH THE CREDITOR DOES NOT KNOW OR SUSPECT TO EXIST IN HIS FAVOR AT THE TIME OF EXECUTING THE RELEASE, WHICH IF KNOWN BY HIM MUST HAVE MATERIALLY AFFECTED HIS SETTLEMENT WITH THE DEBTOR.</p>

We will use reasonable efforts to notify you of any Claim upon becoming aware of it.</p>
            <h2>15.	TERM AND TERMINATION</h2>
            <p>	These Terms will commence on the earlier of the date you register for an Account or you begin using the Service and will terminate on the earlier of the date that: (a) you breach any term or condition, or any representation or warranty set forth in these Terms; or (b) we stop offering the Service at any time either permanently or temporarily or revoke your right to use the Service at any time. If, in our sole discretion, you are in violation of these Terms or our privacy policy, we may suspend, limit your access to, or terminate your use of the Site or any Service. Upon termination of these Terms, all licenses and other rights granted to you in these Terms will immediately cease. The provisions of these Terms that by their nature and context are intended to survive the performance and termination of this Terms, will survive the termination of these Terms.</p>
            <h2>16.	GOVERNING LAW AND DISPUTE RESOLUTION</h2>
            <p>(a)	Governing Law, Arbitration. These Terms are governed by, and interpreted in accordance with, the laws of the State of California except for those conflicts of law rules thereof that would require or permit the application of the laws of another jurisdiction. Any dispute or controversy arising under, out of, or in connection with these Terms shall be resolved by binding arbitration under then current Commercial Rules of the American Arbitration Association (including the expedited procedures and optional rules for emergency measures of protection thereunder) before a single arbitrator. Any such arbitration shall be conducted in San Francisco County, California. Judgment upon any award may be entered in any court of competent jurisdiction. The arbitrator shall be designated by mutual agreement of the parties hereto or, if the parties cannot agree on an arbitrator within ten (10) days after a request for arbitration hereunder, each party shall designate one (1) arbitrator and the arbitrators so designated shall designate a third arbitrator who shall conduct the arbitration. The decision of the arbitrator shall be binding and conclusive upon the parties. Any arbitration award granted hereunder shall be enforceable under the applicable terms and conditions of the Convention on the Recognition and Enforcement of Foreign Arbitral Awards, 1958 (the New York Convention), as amended to date. Notwithstanding the foregoing, Connect shall have the right to seek injunctive relief or other equitable or legal remedies in a court of competent jurisdiction in the State of California, to which jurisdiction, for such purpose, you hereby irrevocably consent. The parties hereto expressly agree these Terms shall not be governed by the provisions of the United Nations Convention on Contracts for the International Sale of Goods. If you bring a legal action or claim against us in contravention of this Section 16, you agree you will reimburse us for our costs and expenses incurred in connection with contesting such action or claim; provided that we notified you in writing of the improperly filed claim, and you failed to promptly withdraw the claim. In the event a non-English version of these Terms is created and there is a conflict of terms between such non-English version and the English version of these Terms, the English version will govern.</p>
            <p>(b)	Class Action Waiver. Any dispute resolution proceedings, whether in arbitration or court, will be conducted only on an individual basis and not in a class or representative action or as a named or unnamed member in a class, consolidated, representative or private attorney general action, unless both you and Connect specifically agree to do so in writing following initiation of an action. This provision is not applicable to the extent such waiver is prohibited by law.</p>
            <p>(c)	Right to Opt Out of Class Action Waiver. If you do not wish to be bound by the class action waiver o, you must notify Connect in writing within 30 days of the date that you accept these terms, unless the law requires a longer period. Your written notice must be sent to Connect Software Corporation, ATTN: Legal, 2 Mint Plaza # 801, San Francisco, CA 94105, or by email at legal@connect.com, with “Class Action Waiver Opt Out” as the subject line. This notice must include (i) your name, (ii) your email address, and (iii) a clear statement that you do not wish to opt out of this class action waiver.</p>
            <h2>17.	NOTICES</h2>
            <p>All notices required or permitted under these Terms will be in writing and delivered to the other party by any of the following methods: (i) U.S. mail, (ii) overnight courier, or (iii) email. To give us notice Connect Software Corporation, ATTN: Legal, 2 Mint Plaza # 801, San Francisco, CA 94105, or email us at <a href="mailto:legal@connect.com">legal@connect.com</a> If we provide notice to you, we will use the email address provided during the Account creation process. All notices will be deemed received (i) if by delivery by U.S. mail, five (5) business days after dispatch, (ii) if by overnight courier, on the date receipt is confirmed by such courier service, or (iii) if by email, 24 hours after the message was sent, if no “system error” or other notice of non-delivery is generated. If applicable law requires that a given communication be “in writing,” you agree that email communication will satisfy this requirement.</p>
            <h2>18.	MISCELLANEOUS</h2>
            <p>(a)	No Waiver. You agree Connect's failure to enforce any right or provision of these Terms will not be deemed a waiver of any such right or provision. In the event that a provision of these Terms is held to be invalid or unenforceable for any reason, then that provision will be limited to the minimum extent necessary to uphold these Terms, and the remaining provisions of these Terms will remain in full force and effect.</p>
            <p>(b)	Export. You agree to abide by U.S. and other applicable export control laws and agree not to take any action which would violate the U.S. Export Administration Regulations, the U.S. Arms Export Control Act or any sanctions policies administered by the U.S. Department of the Treasury's Office of Foreign Assets Control, or cause Connect to be in violation thereof. You represent, warrant and certify that you are not a person with whom Connect (as a U.S. corporation) is prohibited from transacting business under applicable law. If you are located outside the U.S., you hereby consent to having your personal data transferred to and processed in the U.S.</p>
            <p>	(c)	Force Majeure. We will not be liable for any delay or failure to perform resulting from causes outside our reasonable control, including, without limitation, any failure to perform hereunder due to unforeseen circumstances such as acts of God, war, terrorism, riots, embargoes, acts of civil or military authorities, fire, floods, accidents, network infrastructure failures, strikes, or shortages of transportation facilities, fuel, energy, labor or materials.</p>
            <p>	(d)	Entire Agreement. These Terms (including all of the policies and other agreements described in these Terms, which are incorporated herein by this reference) contain all prior and contemporaneous agreements and understandings between you and Connect regarding your use of the Site and any Services.</p>
            <p>	(e)	Severability. The invalidity or unenforceability of any provision of these Terms will not affect the validity or enforceability of any other provision of these Terms, all of which will remain in full force and effect.</p>
            <p>	(f)	Headings. The headings used throughout these Terms are merely descriptive and not operative and have no legal or contractual effect.</p>
            <h2>20. 	COMMENTS AND QUESTIONS</h2>
            <p>If you have any comments or questions, you may address them to Connect Software Corporation at 2 Mint Plaza # 801, San Francisco, CA 94105, or <a href="mailto:support@connect.com">support@connect.com.</a></p>

These types of communications are known as "Operational Communications." In some cases, Operational Communications may also contain commercial messages, such as banner ads and special offers. By registering with the Company, you are agreeing to receive Operational Communications.</p>
            <p>We also use Personal Information to send you newsletters, information, offers and other promotional materials for the Company's services. We attempt to send you offers that are of value to you, such as discounts, exclusive offers or special event information. By registering with the Company, you are opting in to receive such emails. To stop receiving such emails (other than Operational Communications), please send a request email to support@connect.com.</p>
            <p>Further, we may use your Personal Information to: (i) prevent prohibited or illegal activities on the Service; (ii) customize, measure, and improve the Service, its content, and advertising; (iii) inform you of changes to this privacy policy and our terms of service; and (iv) enforce our rights under our agreements with you. In certain instances, our response may be provided to other Service customers or third parties as necessary to respond to any problem, comment, or request.</p>
            <p>Lastly, to operate the Service, including supporting your activities on the Service, we may share your Personal Information with our agents, representatives, contractors and service providers so they can provide us with support services such as authorization of email origination, receipt or support services, customer relationship management services, and promotional fulfillment. We prohibit these parties from using your Personal Information for any other purpose.</p>
            <h2>Special Cases in which We Share Personal and Password Information</h2>
            <p>Your Personal Information may be provided to a third party in the event of a transfer of ownership or assets, or a bankruptcy. We may also disclose Personal Information or Password Information when we determine that such disclosure is necessary to comply with applicable law, to cooperate with law enforcement, or to protect the interests or safety of the Company or visitors to or users of the Service. In such circumstances, you agree the Company may disclose such Personal Information and Password Information to the extent necessary. We may also disclose your Personal Information or Password Information to affiliated legal entities and businesses with whom we are under common corporate control. Whenever Personal Information or Password Information is disclosed under this paragraph, we may also disclose your Demographic Information on a non-anonymous basis. All of our affiliated legal entities and businesses that receive your personal information and demographic information from us will comply with the terms of this privacy policy with respect to their use and disclosure of such information.</p>
            <h2>How We Use Demographic Information</h2>
            <p>We may review all Demographic Information and use it to tailor the Service and all communications to your interests.</p>
            <h2>Our Security Precautions</h2>
            <p>The Service has industry standard security measures in place to protect the loss, misuse and integrity of all information under our control. Although we make good faith efforts to store the information collected by the Service in a secure operating environment that is not available to the public, no data transmissions over the Internet are guaranteed to be completely secure and we cannot guarantee complete security.</p>
            <h2>Use of Other User's Information</h2>
            <p>The Service provides various means of communicating with other Service users through which you may have access to other users' names, email addresses and other information. By using the Service, you agree that, with respect to other user's personally identifiable information that you obtain through your use of the Service, including, without limitation, first and last name, email, photo, hometown, and links to Social Network accounts or user names, as applicable, you will only use such information for: (i) Service related communications that are not unsolicited commercial messages; and (ii) any other purpose that such user expressly agrees to after adequate disclosure of such purpose. Under no circumstances can you disclose personally identifiable information about another user to any third party without our consent and the consent of such other user. We urge you to think carefully about including any specific information you may deem private on the Service.</p>
            <h2>Cookies</h2>
            <p>Like most websites, the Connect Site uses cookies to keep track of your activity on the Connect Site and enhance your experience on the Connect Site. Cookies are strings of text and numbers that can identify your computer to us when you visit the Connect Site. We also use cookies to deliver content specific to your interests, to save your password, and if you choose, to save other personal information so you do not have to reenter it each time you visit the Connect Site. </p>
            <p>There are two types of cookies: session-based cookies and persistent-based cookies. Session-based cookies exist only during an online session. They disappear from your computer when you close your browser software or turn off your computer. Persistent-based cookies remain on your computer after you have closed your browser or turned off your computer. They include such information as a unique identifier for your browser. Standing alone, cookies do not contain personal data, and therefore do not identify you personally; they merely recognize your browser. Unless you choose to identify yourself to us by using the Connect Site, you will remain anonymous to us.</p>
            <p>From time to time, we may engage third parties to track and analyze non-personally identifiable usage and volume statistical information from visitors to the Connect Site to help us administer the Connect Site and improve its quality. Additionally, we may use tools provided by our trusted service providers such as Google Analytics to track use of the Services. If you would like to opt out of third party tracking via Google Analytics, please visit https://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout. Such third parties may use cookies to help track visitor behavior, including visitor responsiveness to online advertisements, and may track visitor behavior across multiple websites. Such cookies will not be used to associate individual Connect Site visitors with any personal data. As such, we do not respond to browser "do not track" requests. Except as otherwise set forth in our terms of use, all data collected by such third parties on our behalf is used only to provide us with information on Connect Site usage and will not be shared with any other third parties.</p>
            <p>Third party advertisers on the Connect Site may also place or read cookies on your browser. If you wish to disable these cookies, the "help" portion of the toolbar on most browsers will tell you how. However, if you set your browser to disable cookies, you may not be able to access certain areas on the Connect Site.</p>
            <h2>Your IP Address</h2>
            <p>Each time you visit the Connect Site, we automatically collect your (i) IP address (which is a number that can be used to identify your location) and (ii) the web page from which you came. In order to administer and optimize the Connect Site for you and to diagnose problems with the Connect Site, we use your IP address to help identify you and to gather broad demographic information about you. We may also collect the web pages visited on the Connect Site.</p>
            <h2>How You Can Access and Update Your Email Preferences and Information</h2>
            <p>We give you the opportunity to opt-out of certain communications and modify personal information or demographic information you have provided to us, and to hide demographic information from, or make demographic information visible to, the public users of the Connect Site, at any time by going to the "My Account" section of the Connect Site. Please be aware that it may take several hours for the changes you make to take effect on the public areas of the Service. We thank you for your patience. Please note that changing or deleting your information through the "My Account" section of the Connect Site, or otherwise opting-out of receipt of email communications from the Company, will only change or delete the data in our database for purposes of future activities on the Service and for managing future communications from the Company. These changes and deletions will not change or delete emails or information that we may have already forwarded to other users or any other third parties, all as provided above in this privacy policy.</p>

            <h2>Changing Our Privacy Policy for Previously Gathered Information</h2>
            <p>Notwithstanding the above, if at any point we decide to use particular personally identifiable information in a manner different from that stated at the time it was collected, we will notify users by way of an email or by providing at least seven (7) days' notice on the Connect Site. Please note that we will continue to have the right to change this privacy policy and practices, and how we use your non-personally identifiable information, without notice, as described in the "Information We Collect From You" paragraph set forth above in this privacy policy.</p>
            <h2>Questions</h2>
